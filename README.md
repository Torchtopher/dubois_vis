The goal of this project was to learn about the diffrent methods for visualizations of W.E.B DuBois and try to recreate one in his style. The main resource I used was the charts we looked at in class as well as a style guide and other charts [here](https://www.dignityanddebt.org/projects/du-boisian-resources/). One of the main things I realized throughout this was just how unique DuBois visualzations were. The typical tools used for making graphs required a lot of small changes to make even a simpler chart look accurate (shown below). There was also a lot of exploring that ended up not translating into a product. I tried to also make the famous [sprial chart](https://www.smithsonianmag.com/history/first-time-together-and-color-book-displays-web-du-bois-visionary-infographics-180970826) but found it to be too difficult within time. I also explored trying to get modern census data, but ended up not being able to find accessible and useable data. This lead me to find the [DuBois Challenge](https://nightingaledvs.com/the-dubois-challenge/) which is really cool, it is essentially other people also recreating DuBois graphs. This is where I got the data from. The chart below went through many interations to look as simmilar as it currently does. Things like background color, font, scaling, axis location, etc. were all considered to try and make as close as possible using modern tools. The code is written in python and can be found in slave_pop.py.
